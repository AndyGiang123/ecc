In hopes that Asians and Asian Americans would start to seek therapy as a means to heal, and recognizing that the Asian community often suffers in silence, she started Asians Do Therapy. </p>

She is a passionate blogger who writes about mental health, feminism, and Asian American identity. Although she had previously struggled with bipolar disorder, her unique experiences capture what it means to endure intergenerational trauma from immigrant parents and overcome the stigma of mental illness in Asian Americans. Her lifestyle as a parent with a mental illness also provides a different perspective about her personal worries that overlap with how to teach the next Asian generation, including her own child. She stresses the importance of separating trauma from culture to embrace your self-worth and identity.</p>
