                    Theme
                    <p> Our theme to Detach the Label is in light of recent worldwide events, including COVID-19 and its fallout on Taiwanese and Asian Americans, as well as ongoing issues including societal representation. Our goal is to detach any labels imposed on us by ourselves, families, and friends in order to feel comfortable and self-sufficient in our capabilities as individuals.</p>

                    <p> Often times, both ourselves and society impose certain beliefs and expectations upon us. While one can succumb to the self-fulfilling prophecies, it is necessary to understand what can be done to eliminate negative labels. Although we attempt to suppress the backlash, the internal conflicts become rather a dreading pendulum in our heads that continues to suppress our true potentials. </p>

                    <p>This issue is especially relevant to the Taiwanese-American community. At the intersection of two cultures, we ironically often rely on labels to build our own identities. We leverage our Taiwanese roots to explain why we are hardworking, and point to our American traits to reason that we are champions of opportunity. This results in us often congregating with other similar Taiwanese or Asian Americans because we feel more accepted. While this can bring increased sense of guidance and support, we must simultaneously strip away the expectations and societally imposed labels in order to discover our purpose as a Taiwanese American.</p>

                    Vision
                    <p> Our vision is to empower Taiwanese-Americans, Asian-Americans, and those interested in these communities to pursue their dreams and overcome any barriers in the process. Through the 2022 East Coast Conference, attendees will understand how to address and detach labels that confine us mentally to certain paths and characteristics in our interpersonal relationships and careers. </p>

                    <p> By incorporating individualized programming content, we aim to challenge conference attendees to reflect more about themselves and what they strive to live for, and also how to challenge societal standards. Workshop speakers will discuss what labels they have faced in these three areas of their lives and their experiences in removing these beliefs in order to achieve success. We hope that the workshops and social events will serve as a welcoming environment for peers to resonate with each other from detaching their labels. </p>
